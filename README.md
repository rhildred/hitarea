hitarea
==

This is a demonstartion of easel.js expanded hit area with 2 bitmaps. The second bitmap was created by adding a layer to the original starfish bitmap in pinta (opensource/multiplatform paint.net clone). The pencil tool was used to draw a bigger area around the starfish, and then the paint bucket was used to fill it with black pixels. I deleted the original layer and did file save as project-starfishhitarea.png and I was done.
